Our features aim to make use of the Kahoot platform to the fullest extent possible, and if you have any suggestions for features we could add, we would love to hear from you in our <a class="underline" href="/discord" target="_blank">Discord Server</a>. We are also working on adding features for teachers, which we hope to release early 2023 </p></div><div class="mt-12"><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Who made Kahoot Rocks?</h2><p class="text-lg"> Kahoot Rocks is built by a talented team of developers with years of experience reverse engineering and building upon web platforms. We previously made Rocks Network, and the world-renowned Quizizz cheat quizizz.rocks, before moving on to make numerous private cheats for GTA Online, finally returning to our roots by releasing the fastest and most advanced version of our site yet </p></div><div class="mt-12"><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Privacy</h2><p class="text-lg"> Privacy is a big concern for us, and find the amount of tracking most sites do these days abhorrent. We also acknowledge that some tracking and analytics are necessary to maintain the site as they help tremendously with diagnosing and fixing issues. We use <a class="underline" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/" target="_blank">Cloudflare Analytics</a> to track some generic stats about the users of our site, with no personally identifying information being gathered or stored. We use this data primarily to find performance issues on certain platforms, and to make sure the platform is usable on the most commonly used devices and browsers. You can read more about this in our <a class="underline" href="/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>. </p></div><div class="mt-12"><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Terms &amp; Conditions</h2><p class="text-lg"> We have some pretty loose terms &amp; conditions, as long as you are an individual using our site for its intended purpose you should be all good. If you are doing anything else with it please contact us first on <a class="underline" href="/discord">Discord</a>. You can read more in our full <a class="underline" href="/terms" target="_blank">Terms &amp; Conditions</a>. </p></div><div class="mt-12"><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-lime">Our Users</h2><p class="text-lg"> Our users are the reason we exist, so we are forever thankful for your support. We want our platform to be as simple to use and secure as possible while having the strongest, most advanced features of any Kahoot bot. We take pride in our community and while we have not maintained the discord server as well as we should, we are always working to add new features and content for our user base </p></div><div class="mt-12"><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Our Mission</h2><p class="text-lg"> We completely redesigned our site to be entirely focused on Kahoot, because it is our favourite platform and is the most lacking in terms of a good cheat. We do not believe in paywalls so we use ads to support the development and running costs of our site, but we aim to make our ads as discreet as we can while still generating enough income to make the sire viable </p></div><div class="mt-12"><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Why Kahoot?</h2><p class="text-lg"> Kahoot is a fun platform, and is a platform that we felt was severely lacking in a good cheat/hack so we set out to fill that gap, and make something people enjoy that works and is as customizable as possible. As said before, we have experience with other quiz services, and quite frankly they are significantly more annoying and aggressive towards these types of projects, whereas so far Kahoot have left us alone to do our own thing and let bored students have a little more fun with their service. If you are a representative of Kahoot reading this, feel free to email us at contact@abstract.land, we&#39;d be happy talk about anything that concerns you </p></div>',7),r=[n];function i(l,d){return t(),a("div",null,r)}const h=e(s,[["render",i]]);export{h as _};
